# paleo-isotope-sections

## Summary of program process
This program reads in and combines two sediment core stable isotope databases. Then it automates some data cleaning and wrangling to filter for the desired geographic location of sediment cores, splice the data set by specified Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) age ranges, calculate a mean stable isotope value for each sediment core within a given MIS, and return a finalized MultiIndex data set. Lastly, the program develops a detailed figure, showing stable isotope values throughout the Atlantic ocean for each MIS.

## Background
The isotopic composition of carbon 

The Atlantic sections represent mean values at each core location for seven time slices, including: MIS 1 (0 to 9 kyr BP), MIS 2 (18 to 28 kyr BP), MIS 4 (59 to 68 kyr BP), MIS 5c (92 to 98 kyr BP), MIS 5d (105 to 114 kyr BP), MIS 5e (118 to 127 kyr BP), and MIS 6 (134 to 144 kyr BP).
